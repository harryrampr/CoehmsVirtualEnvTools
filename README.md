# CoehmsVirtualEnvTools
**Python Virtual Environment tools for the COEHMS platform.**

The COEHMS platform's tools is a set of Github repositories writen in Python 3.6. To handle the requirements of these repositories a common virtual environment needs to be created and maintained on all development and production machines.

On this repository you will find the code to create and update the python virtual environment for the COEHMS's platform. This virtual environment (i.e. coehms_env) needs to exist on all machines at the same location for the system to work.
